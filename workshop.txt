description=
description=[b]Do I need to start a new game?[/b] No.
description=
description=[b]Is it safe to remove this mod mid-play?[/b] Yes. However, removing it will delete the journals held and any progress stored in them; Players will have to re-craft them.
description=
description=[b]Where do I find the journals?[/b] You craft them. The recipe can be found under "bind journal".
description=
description=[b]How do I use the journal?[/b] You will see the option to "transcribe journal" when you have a writing tool and bound journal (that is unclaimed or you've written in before.) Trying to transcribe or read another person's journal in MP will not let you.
description=
description=[b]How does it work?[/b] The journals save unlocked skill levels' respective XP - ignoring profession/trait starter levels. There is also a sandbox option to lower return percentage (default is 100%). [b]In-progress skill levels are not transcribed.[/b]
description=
description=[b]Are recipes saved?[/b] Yes, except for profession/trait gained (just like skill levels).
description=
description=[b]Warning:[/b] Journals have to be manually updated using a pen or pencil. You can check the tool-tip for XP and recipes. Careful if you die holding your journal as it may be difficult to retrieve it from your moving corpse or it could be stolen/destroyed by other players.
