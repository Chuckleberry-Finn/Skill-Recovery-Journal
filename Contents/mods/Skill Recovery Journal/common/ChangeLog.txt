[h3]Old Journal Conversion:[/h3]
[b]They automatically convert when hovered over in your inventory.[/b]
Tweak: Old journals will be covered in blood to better identify them.
[i]Warning: Transcribe once after the journal is converted, just to be safe. More explanation on this later.[/i]
Patch: I've implemented a protection for 'oldXP' which will avoid boosting the old XP.
[i][b]Suggestion:[/b][/i] Read/transcribe into your journal, craft a new one, rinse/repeat.

[h3]Sandbox Options Change: The sandbox option for "Recover Profession And Traits Bonus XP" has been removed.[/h3]
- To clarify: BonusXP in this case refers to the additional XP earned from starting with more than 1 point in a skill. NOT the starting levels, the bonus XP earned.
- The default for this setting for this option was false anyway, and as such that XP was not recorded. All XP that was recorded was that of an unemployed/traitless character.
Going forward this XP will not be recorded, period. This resolves a lot of issues with the math involved, and keeps the XP even across the board.

[h3]XP Change: The XP in the journal going forward will be "raw" values.[/h3]
- With the term 'BonusXP' from above considered, starting level of 0 nets 25% of the raw value. (0=25%, 1=100%, 2=1.33%, 3=1.66%).
- Going forward reading will actually multiply the XP against the player's current XPBoostMap.
- This means the XP shown in your journal's tooltips will be different depending on the starting skills of who is reading it - but the raw-total will never fluctuate.

Fix: Modded skills now can be recorded again. :)
Fix: Issues with mods that change timed action speed should be fixed for good.
Added: A Gained XP counter in the skills menu - this shows the value of XP earned after character creation and what should be transcribed.
Added: Tooltip warning on journals for 'Use up XP' sandbox option.
